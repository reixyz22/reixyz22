# Hi there, I'm William Pitts 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate **Software Engineer** with a keen interest in **game development**, algorithms, and building impactful solutions. I love solving complex problems, creating engaging digital experiences, and contributing to meaningful projects.

## 🎮 About Me

I'm a software engineer dedicated to crafting innovative solutions across multiple domains—from competitive algorithm challenges to real-world automation systems, and game development. I'm passionate about clean code, optimization, and creating technology that makes a genuine impact. Whether it's optimizing algorithms, automating nonprofit workflows, or building games, I approach every project with enthusiasm and attention to detail. I would call myself a generalist, but also with the ability to hyper-focus on a specfic task. I genuinely enjoy bug hunting, also-- Esp considering my teaching background as a peer leader at NEIU and a summer camp teaching assistant at Northwestern; I love that feeling of shifting in a new context and solving a unique problem.
